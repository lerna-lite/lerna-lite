## 📢 Lerna-Lite supports pnpm/yarn `workspace:` protocol and pnpm `catalog:` protocol

Take 30sec. to complete this 1 question [poll survey 🔘](https://github.com/lerna-lite/lerna-lite/discussions/156) if you are using this feature. It's a simple poll to find out which package manager is the most popular with `workspace:` protocol (so far, about 60% pnpm and 40% yarn).

Lerna-Lite itself is also using both [pnpm catalogs](https://pnpm.io/catalogs) and [pnpm workspaces](https://pnpm.io/workspaces) 🎉

## About Lerna-Lite

Lerna-Lite differs from the original [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna), the latter now install & require Nx (which is large) and it has 15 buit-in commands. Lerna-Lite, on the other hand doesn't require Nx and only has a limited subset of the original commands (9 out of 15 commands) and they are **all optional** in Lerna-Lite making its install footprint a lot smaller. Lerna was originally built as an all-in-one tool, however nowadays, Workspaces are available in all package managers and the need for an all-in-one tool, which includes built-in workspaces functionalities (like `bootstrap`), is no longer necessary. Lerna-Lite is built around this new reality and is only providing commands that package managers do not yet provide or are less efficient. To summarize, Lerna-Lite is much more modular than the original Lerna and you'll end up installing a lot less dependencies while also making it more versatile to use with other tools like TurboRepo, pnpm and others...

Lerna-Lite assumes, and requires that you pre-setup your Workspace through your favorite package manager (npm, pnpm, yarn) that will take care of the symlinks. Lerna-Lite does **not include** Lerna's `bootstrap`, `add`, `create` or `link` commands hence the need for you to properly set up your workspace prior to installing Lerna-Lite.

According to your needs, choose the best option to set up a workspace: [npm 7+](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/workspaces) | [Yarn classic](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces) | [Yarn 2+](https://yarnpkg.com/features/workspaces) | [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/workspaces)

## Why create this lib/fork?

Below are the main reasons as to why this fork was created:

1. Lerna's repo was unmaintained for nearly 2 years (in early 2022, Lerna's dependencies were really out of date)
    - Lerna (original) was later transferred to Nrwl, the company behind Nx, and are now the current maintainers
        - please note that Lerna-Lite fork was created couple months **before** Nrwl took over Lerna
        - we also replicate all Lerna PRs whenever possible (except for `Nx` specific changes, which are ignored)
2. A desire to create a smaller and lighter alternative compared to the original all-in-one Lerna tool
    - Lerna-Lite is entirely modular, each command being totally optional (install only what you need).
3. The project was rewritten in TypeScript with ESM-only since v2.0 (you can still use it in a CJS environment)
4. The original Lerna version v5.5+ now requires **[Nx](https://nx.dev/)** (want it or not), but that is not the case in Lerna-Lite
   - note, if you already use `Nx` then it's probably better to use Lerna, otherwise Lerna-Lite is a better alternative
   - if you use tools like TurboRepo and install the original Lerna, you end up installing 2 similar tools (not good)
5. in Lerna-Lite we also added a few unique features that are not available in the original Lerna:
   - [`catalog:` protocol support](https://github.com/lerna-lite/lerna-lite/tree/main/packages/version#catalog-protocol) for both `version` and `publish` commands (new)
   - [`workspace:` protocol support](https://github.com/lerna-lite/lerna-lite/tree/main/packages/version#workspace-protocol)
     * _Lerna added support for the same feature 6 months later in their v6.0 release_
   - [--dry-run](https://github.com/lerna-lite/lerna-lite/tree/main/packages/version#--dry-run) to preview version/publish & changelogs locally (shows git changes without committing them)
   - [lerna version --allow-peer-dependencies-update](https://github.com/lerna-lite/lerna-lite/tree/main/packages/version#--allow-peer-dependencies-update) to also update your peer dependencies
   - [lerna version --changelog-header-message "msg"](https://github.com/lerna-lite/lerna-lite/tree/main/packages/version#--changelog-header-message-msg) for showing banner or sponsors in your changelogs
   - [lerna version --changelog-include-commits-client-login](https://github.com/lerna-lite/lerna-lite/tree/main/packages/version#--changelog-include-commits-client-login-msg) to add PR contributors to GitHub releases
   - [lerna publish --strip-package-keys](https://github.com/lerna-lite/lerna-lite/tree/main/packages/publish#--strip-package-keys-keys) (strip certain keys from `package.json` before publishing)
     - i.e.: we use it in here to publish Lerna-Lite without any `scripts` or `devDependencies`
   - [lerna version --skip-bump-only-releases](https://github.com/lerna-lite/lerna-lite/tree/main/packages/version#--skip-bump-only-releases), avoid cluttering your GitHub releases when using `independent`
   - [lerna version --sync-workspace-lock](https://github.com/lerna-lite/lerna-lite/tree/main/packages/version#--sync-workspace-lock) to sync lock file before publishing (not needed w/`workspace:` protocol)

On a final note, I think that the best feature of Lerna-Lite (versus Lerna) must be its modularity. A large portion of the users are only interested in version/publish commands, but on the other hand, a small minority might want other commands like `lerna run`/`exec`. Lerna-Lite offers this kind of flexibility by allowing the user to choose what to install (see [installation](#cli-installation) below) which help to keep your download to the bare minimum.

### Lerna-Lite will help you with the following:

> **Note** all commands are optional in Lerna-Lite, refer to the [Available Commands](#available-commands) table for more info

#### [Version](https://github.com/lerna-lite/lerna-lite/tree/main/packages/version) and [Publish](https://github.com/lerna-lite/lerna-lite/tree/main/packages/publish) commands

- Automate the creation of new Versions (`independent` or `fixed` version) of all your workspace packages.
  - it will automatically Commit/Tag your new Version & create new GitHub/GitLab Release (when enabled).
- Automate, when enabled, will create Changelogs for all packages by reading your [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).
- Automate, the repository Publishing of your new version(s) for all your packages (on NPM or other platforms).

#### Other optional commands

- [Changed](https://github.com/lerna-lite/lerna-lite/tree/main/packages/changed#readme) command, when installed, will list all local packages that have changed since the last tagged release
- [Diff](https://github.com/lerna-lite/lerna-lite/tree/main/packages/diff#readme) command, when installed, will show git diff of all packages or a single package since the last release
- [Exec](https://github.com/lerna-lite/lerna-lite/tree/main/packages/exec#readme) command, when installed, will help you execute shell commands in parallel and in topological order.

```

## Getting Started

Let's start by installing Lerna-Lite CLI as a dev dependency to your project and then run the `init` command to get started (see [init#readme](https://github.com/lerna-lite/lerna-lite/tree/main/packages/init#readme) for all options). Note that the CLI must be installed at all time, then proceed by installing any other optional commands (the CLI is only including the `init` command), refer to the **[Available Commands](#available-commands) table** for more info.

```sh
# install Lerna-Lite CLI locally or globally (`init` is the only command installed)
$ npm install -g @lerna-lite/cli # pnpm add -g @lerna-lite/cli

# create your monorepo and initialize lerna-lite
$ mkdir lerna-repo
$ cd lerna-repo
$ npx lerna init # OR pnpm exec lerna init

# for npm/yarn (only) workspaces add --use-workspaces
$ npx lerna init --use-workspaces
```

This will create a `lerna.json` configuration file as well as a `packages` folder, so your folder should now look like this:

```
lerna-repo/
  packages/
    package-a
  package.json
  lerna.json
```

**Note** Lerna-Lite now supports 3 file extension types (`.json`, `.jsonc` and `.json5`), however please note that not all code editors support [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) with `.json5`, so `lerna.json` might still be the preferred file extension (all formats support inline comments, even `.json`). 

Note that `package-a` show above will not be created, it is only shown here to help clarify the structure. For more info and full details about the `lerna.json` file, please read the [lerna.json](https://github.com/lerna-lite/lerna-lite/wiki/lerna.json) Wiki. Also note that you can optionally add comments to your `lerna.json` config file since it is also able to parse JSON5 file format.

The final step will be to install the commands that are of interest to you (`publish`, `version`, `run`, `exec`, ...)

```sh
$ npm i @lerna-lite/publish -D
```

## How It Works

Lerna allows you to manage your project using one of two modes: Fixed or Independent.

### Fixed/Locked mode (default)

Fixed mode Lerna projects operate on a single version line. The version is kept in the `lerna.json` file at the root of your project under the `version` key. When you run `lerna publish`, if a module has been updated since the last time a release was made, it will be updated to the new version you're releasing. This means that you only publish a new version of a package when you need to.

> Note: If you have a major version zero, all updates are [considered breaking](https://semver.org/#spec-item-4). Because of that, running `lerna publish` with a major version zero and choosing any non-prerelease version number will cause new versions to be published for all packages, even if not all packages have changed since the last release.

This is the mode that [Jest](https://github.com/jestjs/jest)) is currently using. Use this if you want to automatically tie all package versions together. One issue with this approach is that a major change in any package will result in all packages having a new major version.

### Independent mode

`lerna init --independent`

Independent mode Lerna projects allows maintainers to increment package versions independently of each other. Each time you publish, you will get a prompt for each package that has changed to specify if it's a patch, minor, major or custom change.

Independent mode allows you to more specifically update versions for each package and makes sense for a group of components. Combining this mode with something like [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) would make it less painful. (There is work on this already at [atlassian/lerna-semantic-release](https://github.com/atlassian/lerna-semantic-release)).

> Set the `version` key in `lerna.json` to `independent` to run in independent mode.

## Installation

> Lerna-Lite is entirely modular, as opposed to Lerna, and installing the CLI locally or globally will only provide you the `init` command. Please make sure to install other commands that you are interested in (see table below).

If you are new to Lerna-Lite, you could also run the [lerna init](https://github.com/lerna-lite/lerna-lite/tree/main/packages/init#readme) command, which will create the `lerna.json` for you with a minimal structure setup. If you are using a client other than npm, then make sure to update the `npmClient` property in `lerna.json` (for example: `"npmClient": "yarn"` or `"pnpm"`).

> **Note** please make sure that you have a `lerna.json` config file in your project root and in it a `version` property defined with either a fixed or `independent` mode. Otherwise, an error will be thrown if you're missing any of them.

### Usage

The basic usage is to add either custom NPM scripts or simply run the commands in your shell with the Lerna-Lite CLI. See below for basic Lerna npm script samples.

```js
// package.json / npm scripts
"scripts": {
  "new-version": "lerna version",
  "new-publish": "lerna publish from-package",
  "preview:new-version": "lerna version --dry-run",
  "run-tests": "lerna run test",
}
```

### JSON Schema
You can add the `$schema` property into your `lerna.json` to take advantage of Lerna-Lite [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) (`lerna init` can help to set it up for you). This will help with the developer experience, users will be able to see what properties are valid with their types and a brief description of what each option does (descriptions are pulled from their associated lerna command options documentation).

##### `lerna.json`
```js
{
  "$schema": "node_modules/@lerna-lite/cli/schemas/lerna-schema.json",
  // ...

  // or from GitHub CDN
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lerna-lite/lerna-lite/main/packages/cli/schemas/lerna-schema.json",
}
```

> **Note** JSON Schema might not be well supported by all code editors with `.json5`, use `lerna.json` if that is a problem for you.

> **Note** since the `publish` package depends on the `version` package, you could simply install `@lerna-lite/publish` to automatically gain access to both commands.

### Migration for existing [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) users

Migrating from the original Lerna, should be fairly easy since you simply need to replace your Lerna dependency with Lerna-Lite `@lerna-lite/cli`, and also install the command(s) that you are interested in and that's about it. The CLI commands and options are nearly identical. The biggest difference compared to Lerna is that you need to manually choose and install the commands that you are interested in, as shown below:

> **Note** as opposed to Lerna v7 and higher, the `useWorkspace` is **not** enabled by default in Lerna-Lite and we still recommend to use either `useWorkspaces` for Yarn/NPM or use the default `packages` in `lerna.json` for pnpm users. The `useWorkspaces` has some drawback since some of the packages could be unrelated to the project releases (ie: website, examples) and for this use case the `packages/*` defined in `lerna.json` is a better approach (i.e. [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) uses this approach).

1. remove Lerna from your local & global dependencies

```sh
npm uninstall lerna      # OR yarn remove lerna -W
npm uninstall -g lerna   # OR yarn global remove lerna
```

2. install Lerna-Lite CLI, note this will **only** provide you the `init` command

```sh
# Lerna CLI (only includes `init`)
npm install @lerna-lite/cli -D
```

3. then install any of the optional Lerna-Lite command(s) that you wish to use (`changed`, `diff`, `exec`, `list`, `run`, `publish`, `version` and/or `watch`)
_refer to [Available Commands](#available-commands) table above_

```sh
# for example, let's install publish (note publish will automatically provide you the `version` command since it's a dependency)
npm install @lerna-lite/publish -D
```

4. review your `lerna.json` config file and remove any unrelated old command options, for example `bootstrap` does not exist in Lerna-Lite so there's no need to keep that config
```diff
{
    "npmClient": "yarn",
    "command": {
        "version": {
            "conventionalCommits": true
        },
-       "bootstrap": {
-           "npmClientArgs": ["--no-package-lock"]
-       }
    }
}
```
> **Note** after switching to Lerna-Lite and publishing your next release with conventional-changelog, you will probably see a lot of diff changes across your `changelog.md` files, a lot of empty lines will be deleted, and that is totally expected since Lerna-Lite has code in place to remove these unnecessary empty lines.

## Project Demo?

You want to see a project demo? Sure... you're looking at it 😉

Yes indeed, this project was originally created as an NPM Workspace and later migrated to a [pnpm workspaces](https://pnpm.io/workspaces) for the sole purpose of demoing and testing its own code. All changelogs and versions are created and published by the lib itself, how sweet is that? You can also see that this project has its own [`lerna.json`](https://github.com/lerna-lite/lerna-lite/blob/main/lerna.json) config file as well to run properly (take a look to see how it works).

### See it in Action 🎦

You can see a small video of a new version release on this [Release Demo - Wiki](https://github.com/lerna-lite/lerna-lite/wiki/Release-Demo) to demonstrate its usage. Are you confused with all these options? Perhaps taking a look at some of the references shown below might help you get started.

## Contributions

[![PR](https://img.shields.io/badge/PR-Welcome-1abc9c)](https://github.com/lerna-lite/lerna-lite/pulls)

Contributions are very well encouraged. Also please note that the original code was created by much smarter persons than myself and so my knowledge of the project might still lack in some areas of the project. The main goal of this fork was mainly to make it more modular and keep dependencies up to date (Renovate was put in place and is running frequently). 

### Development / Contributions

To contribute to the project, please follow the steps shown in the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/lerna-lite/lerna-lite/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Troubleshooting

If you have problems running the project and your problems are related to Git commands that were executed, we then suggest to first try with the `--dry-run` option to see if it helps in finding the error(s) that you may have. Another great, and possibly much more useful suggestion, is to search in the original Lerna [issues](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/issues) list and see if any solution could help you (remember that Lerna-Lite is a fork of the original code from Lerna and it works the same way). Lastly, if that is not enough and you wish to troubleshoot yourself, then read this [Troubleshooting - Wiki](https://github.com/lerna-lite/lerna-lite/wiki/Troubleshooting) to possibly troubleshoot yourself the execution in your own environment.
